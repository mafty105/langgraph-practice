# Learning LangGraph Step-by-Step Guide

This document tracks our incremental development of the Email Assistant CLI, focusing on learning LangGraph concepts progressively.

## Overview

We'll build the Email Assistant CLI in small, digestible steps, starting with basic concepts and gradually adding complexity. Each step will introduce new LangGraph concepts while building practical features.

## Learning Path Structure

Each step will include:
1. **Concept**: The LangGraph concept we're learning
2. **Implementation**: Small code changes
3. **Testing**: How to verify it works
4. **Key Takeaways**: What we learned

## Step 1: Basic State Management

### Concept
Learn how LangGraph manages state using TypedDict and how state flows through the graph.

### Implementation Plan
1. Create a simple EmailState TypedDict
2. Add basic state fields (subject, body, recipient)
3. Create a function to print state

### Files to Create/Modify
- `email_assistant/core/__init__.py`
- `email_assistant/core/state.py`
- `email_assistant/cli.py` (add simple state demo command)

### Testing
- Unit test for state creation
- CLI command to demonstrate state

### Key Concepts to Learn
- TypedDict for state definition
- State immutability in LangGraph
- Basic type safety with Pydantic

---

## Step 2: Simple Node Creation

### Concept
Create your first LangGraph node - a simple function that modifies state.

### Implementation Plan
1. Create a node that formats the email subject
2. Create a node that adds a greeting to the body
3. Learn node function signatures

### Files to Create/Modify
- `email_assistant/core/nodes/__init__.py`
- `email_assistant/core/nodes/basic_nodes.py`

### Testing
- Test each node independently
- Test state transformation

### Key Concepts to Learn
- Node function signatures
- State in, state out pattern
- Pure functions in LangGraph

---

## Step 3: Linear Graph Flow

### Concept
Connect nodes in a simple linear sequence to create your first graph.

### Implementation Plan
1. Create a StateGraph instance
2. Add nodes to the graph
3. Connect nodes with edges
4. Compile and run the graph

### Files to Create/Modify
- `email_assistant/core/graphs/__init__.py`
- `email_assistant/core/graphs/simple_graph.py`
- `email_assistant/cli.py` (add graph execution command)

### Testing
- Test graph compilation
- Test end-to-end execution
- Verify state transformations

### Key Concepts to Learn
- StateGraph construction
- add_node() method
- add_edge() method
- Graph compilation
- Graph execution

---

## Step 4: Conditional Edges

### Concept
Add decision-making to your graph with conditional edges.

### Implementation Plan
1. Create a router function
2. Add conditional edges based on email type
3. Create different paths for different email types

### Files to Create/Modify
- `email_assistant/core/nodes/router_nodes.py`
- Update `simple_graph.py` with conditional logic

### Testing
- Test router logic
- Test different execution paths
- Verify correct path selection

### Key Concepts to Learn
- Conditional edges
- Router functions
- Path selection logic
- Graph branching

---

## Step 5: State Persistence

### Concept
Learn to save and restore graph execution state.

### Implementation Plan
1. Add memory/checkpoint support
2. Save state between executions
3. Resume from saved state

### Files to Create/Modify
- `email_assistant/core/memory/__init__.py`
- `email_assistant/core/memory/checkpointer.py`

### Testing
- Test state saving
- Test state restoration
- Test resume functionality

### Key Concepts to Learn
- Checkpointing
- State persistence
- Memory management
- Resume capabilities

## Development Guidelines

### For Each Step:

1. **Start Small**: Implement the minimal code needed to demonstrate the concept
2. **Test Immediately**: Write tests before moving to the next step
3. **Document**: Add docstrings and comments explaining LangGraph concepts
4. **Iterate**: Refactor if needed, but keep changes minimal

### Code Style:
- Use type hints everywhere
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive names that reflect LangGraph concepts
- Add inline comments for learning points

### Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for graph flows
- CLI commands to manually test features

## Progress Tracking

### Current Step: Not Started
### Next Step: Step 1 - Basic State Management

## Notes Section

### Things to Remember:
- Each step builds on the previous one
- Focus on understanding concepts, not just copying code
- Test everything to ensure understanding
- Ask questions when concepts aren't clear

## Questions to Answer at Each Step

1. What LangGraph concept did we learn?
2. How does this concept work internally?
3. When would we use this in a real application?
4. What are the best practices?
5. What are common pitfalls to avoid?
